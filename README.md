ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Michelle Swem

I'm a meticulous Frontend Developer and content writer with a great passion for building responsive website.
A firm believer in using the best practices of writing clean and maintainable codes.

As a productive frontend Developer, I am dedicated to learning additional technology skills and coding languages.
I love sharing my knowledge with others, and I do that through content writing on my personal blog.

My believe is, When you embrace yourself and you believe in your dreams, then you can be whatever you want to be as long as you put your heart to it.
